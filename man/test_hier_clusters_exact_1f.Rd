\description{
This tests the null hypothesis of no difference in means in the mean of
feature \code{feat} between clusters \code{k1} and \code{k2} at
level \code{K} in a hierarchical clustering. (The \code{K} clusters are
numbered as per the results of the \code{cutree} function in the
\code{stats} package.)
}
\details{
In order to account for the fact that the clusters have been estimated from the data,
the p-values are computed conditional on the fact that those clusters were estimated.
This function computes p-values exactly via an analytic characterization of the conditioning set.

Currently, this function supports squared Euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity
between observations, and the following six linkages: single, average, centroid, Ward,
McQuitty (also known as WPGMA), and median (also kown as WPGMC).

By default, this function assumes that the features are independent. If known,
the variance of feature \code{feat} (\eqn{\sigma}) can be passed in using the
\code{sigma} argument; otherwise, an estimate of \eqn{\sigma} will be used.

Setting \code{ind} to \code{FALSE} allows the features to be dependent, i.e.
\eqn{Cov(X_i) = \Sigma}. If known, \eqn{\Sigma} can be passed in using the \code{covMat} argument;
otherwise, an estimate of \eqn{\Sigma} will be used.
